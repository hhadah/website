summary: "In this talk, I describe a study identifying whole brain voxel-by-voxel gene expression patterns of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and its association with cognitive states via a large-scale fMRI meta-analysis of 14,371 studies. Data from two clinical trials are also presented demonstrating that compared to placebo, 8IU intranasal oxytocin (but not 24IU intranasal oxytocin or 1IU intravenous oxytocin) modulates social cognition, pupil diameter, and neural activity."
