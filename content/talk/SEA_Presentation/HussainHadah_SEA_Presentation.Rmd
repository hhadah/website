# Research Questions

<h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Does ethnic favoritism exist?</li>
  </ul>
</h2>

--
<h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Does a change in a country's political system (democracy to dictatorship and <em>vice versa</em>) affect ethnic favoritism?</li>

#### Outcomes of Interest

<h5>For my analysis, I will use several outcomes:</h3>

<h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Primary school completion</li>
    <li>Infant survival</li>
    <li>Wealth</li>
    <li>Electrification</li>
    <li>Access to clean drinking water</li>
  </ol>
</h5>

# Motivation
<ul>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->"> <strong>Ethnic favoritism has been widespread in Africa and it negatively affects growth</strong> (La Porta et al., 1999; Alesina, Baqir and Easterly, 1999; Alesina et al., 2003; Alesina and Zhuravskaya, 2011)</li>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->"><strong>Ethnic diversity also affects the productivity of labor </strong>(Lazear, 1999; Habyarimana et al., 2007; Hjort, 2014)</li>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->"><strong>Investigating the effect of democracy on ethnic favoritism is important</strong></li>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->"><strong>According to the Congressional Research Service</strong> (Husted et al., 2020), <strong>the US provided more than $7.1 Billion in aid to Sub-Saharan Africa. Allocating these funds to countries that will distribute them equally among citizen could be of importance to policy makers</strong></li>

# What is ethnic favoritism?

<h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Is the act in which the leader of a country would give preferential treatment to members of their own ethnic group</li>
  </ul>

# Previewing the Results

<h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Ethnic favoritism:</li>
  </ul>
</h3>
<h4>
  <ol>
    <li>A co-ethnic mother's child is 1.3 percentage points more likely to sruvive the first year of birth</li>
    <li>A co-ethnic person is more likely to have access to clean drinking water</li>
    <li>A co-ethnic person is just as likely as a non-co-ethnic to finish primary school, have access to electricity and belong to the same wealth quintile</li>
  </ol>

# Polity IV as a Measure of Democracy

<h3>The Political Instability Task Force, a government-funded project, administers the measure. The index categorizes countries using five criteria:</h3>

<h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Elections for the executive are competitive</li>
    <li>Openness in running for office</li>
    <li>Regulation of political participation</li>
    <li>Competitive political participation</li>
    <li>Constraints on the executive branch</li>
  </ol>

# Data on Leader's Ethnicity

    </ul>

# Constructing the Co-ethnicity Variable

<h3>For each outcome I used in my analysis, I constructed a co-ethnicity variable:
</h3>

<h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Primary school education: the portion of time spent under the rule of a co-ethnic leader between the ages of 6 and 13</li>
    <li>co-ethnicity is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the leader two years before a child's birth was co-ethnic with the mother</li>
    <li>Wealth: the portion of time spent under the rule of co-ethnic leader in the four years before the survey</li>
    <li>Electrification & Access to water: the portion of time spent under the rule of co-ethnic leader in the two years before the survey</li>
  </ol>
