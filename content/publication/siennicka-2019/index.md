abstract: "Heart rate variability (HRV) is a widely used measure that reflects autonomic\
  \ (parasympathetic) control of the heart. HRV has been linked with attentional performance,\
  \ but it is unclear to what extent resting HRV is associated with both attention\
  \ and attentional maintenance. In order to address this, we calculated HRV in seventy-four\
  \ young and healthy volunteers (43 men, age: 21.6 ± 2.4), who completed the D2 Test\
  \ of Attention (D2), which was used to calculate an index of Concentration Performance\
  \ (CP) and a measure of attention maintenance, the coefficient of variation (CV).\
  \ After accounting for the effects of sex and age on HRV, there was no significant\
  \ association between HRV and CP (p = .2), but a significant relationship between\
  \ HRV and CV (p = .03). Overall, our study demonstrates that attention maintenance,\
  \ but not attentional performance, is associated with higher resting state HRV which\
  \ suggests that attentional performance from D2 subtest-to-subtest may reflect HRV's\
  \ facilitation of behaviour flexibility."
