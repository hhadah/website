abstract: Converging evidence demonstrates the important role of the neuropeptide
  hormone oxytocin (OT) in human behaviour and cognition. Intranasal OT administration
  has been shown to improve several aspects of social communication, such as the theory
  of mind performance and gaze to the eye region, and reduce anxiety and related negative
  cognitive appraisals. While this early research has demonstrated the potential for
  intranasal OT to treat psychiatric illnesses characterized by social impairments,
  the neurobiological mechanisms are not well known. Researchers have used functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of OT response;
  however, results have been variable and moderating factors are poorly understood.
  The aim of this meta-analysis is to synthesize data examining the impact of intranasal
  OT administration on neural activity.
