abstract: Here we review our recent body of work on the impact of mood and comorbid
  anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, and their treatments on heart rate variability
  (HRV), a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical wellbeing. We have shown
  that otherwise healthy, unmedicated patients with these disorders display reduced
  resting-state HRV, and that pharmacological treatments do not ameliorate these reductions.
  Other studies highlight that tricyclic medications and the serotonin and noradrenaline
  reuptake inhibitors in particular may have adverse cardiovascular consequences.
  Reduced HRV has important functional significance for motivation to engage social
  situations, social approach behaviours, self-regulation and psychological flexibility
  in the face of stressors. Over the longer-term, reduced HRV leads to immune dysfunction
  and inflammation, cardiovascular disease and mortality, attributable to the downstream
  effects of a poorly functioning cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex. We place our
  research in the context of the broader literature base and propose a working model
  for the effects of mood disorders, comorbid conditions, and their treatments to
  help guide future research activities. Further research is urgently needed on the
  long-term effects of autonomic dysregulation in otherwise healthy psychiatric patients,
  and appropriate interventions to halt the progression of a host of conditions associated
  with morbidity and mortality.
