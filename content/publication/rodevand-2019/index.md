abstract: 'Objective: While CVD risk has decreased in the general population during
  the last decade, the situation in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar
  disorder (BD) is unknown.  Methods: We compared CVD risk factors in patients with
  SCZ and BD recruited from 2002-2005 (2005 sample, N = 270) with patients recruited
  from 2006-2017 (2017 sample, N = 1011) from the same catchment area in Norway. The
  2017 sample was also compared with healthy controls (N = 922) and the general population
  (N range = 1285-4587, Statistics Norway) from the same area and period.  Results:
  Patients with SCZ and BD in the 2017 sample had significantly higher level of most
  CVD risk factors compared to healthy controls and the general population. There
  was no significant difference in the prevalence of CVD risk factors in SCZ between
  the 2005 and 2017 samples except a small increase in glucose in the 2017 sample.
  There were small-to-moderate reductions in hypertension, obesity, total cholesterol,
  low-density lipoprotein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the BD 2017 sample
  compared to the 2005 sample.  Conclusion: Despite major advances in health promotion
  during the past decade, there has been no reduction in the level of CVD risk factors
  in patients with SCZ and modest improvement in BD.'
