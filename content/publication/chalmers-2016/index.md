abstract: "Background: Individuals with anxiety disorders display reduced resting-state\
  \ heart rate variability (HRV), although findings have been contradictory and the\
  \ role of specific symptoms has been less clear. It is possible that HRV reductions\
  \ may transcend diagnostic categories, consistent with dimensional-trait models\
  \ of psychopathology. Here we investigated whether anxiety disorders or symptoms\
  \ of anxiety, stress, worry and depression are more strongly associated with resting-state\
  \ HRV.  Methods: Resting-state HRV was calculated in participants with clinical\
  \ anxiety (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 58). Symptom severity measures of worry,\
  \ anxiety, stress, and depression were also collected from participants, regardless\
  \ of diagnosis.  Results: Participants who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for an anxiety\
  \ disorder displayed diminished HRV, a difference at trend level significance (p\
  \ = .1, Hedges' g = -.37, BF10 = .84). High worriers (Total n = 41; n = 22 diagnosed\
  \ with an anxiety disorder and n = 19 not meeting criteria for any psychopathology)\
  \ displayed a robust reduction in resting state HRV relative to low worriers (p\
  \ = .001, Hedges' g = -.75, BF10 = 28.16).  Conclusions: The specific symptom of\
  \ worry - not the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder - was associated with the most\
  \ robust reductions in HRV, indicating that HRV may provide a transdiagnostic biomarker\
  \ of worry. These results enhance understanding of the relationship between the\
  \ cardiac autonomic nervous system and anxiety psychopathology, providing support\
  \ for dimensional-trait models consistent with the Research Domain Criteria framework."
