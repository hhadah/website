title: 'Age-related differences in the error-related negativity and error positivity
  in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'The main objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to evaluate the effect of age on error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe) magnitude in children and adolescents, and to examine potential moderators of these effects, including age, sex, experimental task, task difficulty, and topography and quantification of the ERN and the Pe'

abstract: 'Background: The error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity
  (Pe) are electrophysiological signals linked to error processing, a crucial aspect
  of self-monitoring and regulation. Previous research suggests different developmental
  trajectories for the ERN and Pe, with the ERN increasing in strength during the
  course of childhood and adolescence, while the Pe appears to reach a plateau by
  late childhood. There are, however, reports that are discrepant with this pattern,
  and effects of participant, task and methodological characteristics are poorly understood.
  The main objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to evaluate
  the effect of age on ERN and Pe magnitude in children and adolescents, and to examine
  potential moderators of these effects, including age, sex, experimental task, task
  difficulty, and topography and quantification of the ERN and Pe.   Methods/design:
  Studies that report group differences between age-groups or associations with age
  for the ERN and/or Pe magnitude in typically developing children and/or adolescents
  will be identified. The literature search will be conducted through PubMed and Scopus,
  all abstracts will be screened, and reference lists of relevant articles cross-checked
  for inclusion. The present protocol will also be disseminated on social media platforms
  to call for unpublished data. The data will be extracted from the eligible studies
  and will be included in random-effect meta-analyses in R. The results will include
  the estimation of age and age-group effect sizes, heterogeneity, risk of publication
  bias, and effects of moderating variables.   Discussion: The study will include
  a systematic literature search and meta-analyses to better understand age-related
  differences in the ERN and Pe magnitudes. The results will provide estimates of
  effect sizes that are relevant for calculating statistical power and sample sizes
  for future studies. In addition, it will provide benchmark effect sizes for typical
  development of the ERN and the Pe that could be used for comparison purposes in
  developmental studies of clinical or at-risk groups.'
