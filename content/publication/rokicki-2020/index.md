abstract: The measurement of gene expression levels in the human brain can help accelerate
  our understanding of complex mental states and psychiatric illnesses. Mental states
  are typically associated with whole-brain networks, however, gene expression levels
  from post-mortem brain samples have traditionally been measured in a limited number
  of brain regions due to resource limitations. The recent availability of whole-brain
  gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) provides the opportunity
  to generate gene expression patterns for over 20,000 genes. By linking these expression
  patterns with brain activity patterns that are associated with specific mental states,
  researchers can better understand which genes may support given mental states, via
  forward inference. Conversely, reverse inference can also be used to determine which
  mental state activation patterns are most strongly associated with a given gene
  expression map. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the AHBA
  in conjunction with the NeuroSynth fMRI meta-analysis tool to identify the mental
  state correlates of specific gene expression patterns, using genes from oxytocin
  signaling pathway as an example. We also demonstrate how to perform an out-of-sample
  validation and assess the specificity of results for genes of interest.
