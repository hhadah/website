abstract: 'Background: Past research has highlighted an important role of the autonomic
  nervous system in alcohol dependence and capacity for self-regulation. While previous
  studies have examined alcohol dependent inpatients, it remains unclear whether resting-state
  HRV, a potential psychophysiological marker of ones capacity for self-regulation,
  is related to craving in patients who currently consume alcohol. Thus, the aim of
  the present study was to determine whether HRV predicts alcohol craving in dependent
  individuals in the community. Methods: Resting-state HRV and alcohol craving, as
  indexed by the obsessive compulsive drinking scale, were assessed in 26 alcohol
  dependent outpatients. Results: Results supported hypotheses indicating that HRV
  accounts for an additional 12.1% of the variance in craving after controlling for
  age, anxiety and levels of alcohol consumption. Here we show for the first time
  that resting-state HRV predicts craving in alcohol dependent outpatients. Conclusion:
  Results provide important new evidence for a role of the autonomic nervous system
  in the maintenance of dependence disorders. (copyright) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.'
