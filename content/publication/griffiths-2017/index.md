abstract: 'The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in attention
  and self-regulation by modulating physiological arousal to meet environmental demands.
  Core symptoms of ADHD such as inattention and behavioral disinhibition may be related
  to dysregulation of the ANS, however previous findings have been equivocal. We examined
  autonomic activity and reactivity by assessing heart rate variability (HRV) in a
  large sample of un-medicated children and adolescents (6â€“19 years) with ADHD (n=229)
  compared to typically-developing controls (n=244) during rest and sustained attention.
  Four heart rate variability measures were extracted: Root mean square of successive
  differences between inter-beat-intervals (rMSSD), absolute high frequency (HFA)
  power, absolute low frequency (LFA) power and ratio of low frequency power to high
  frequency power (LF/HF). There were no group differences in HFA or rMSSD, even when
  assessing across child and adolescent groups separately, by gender or ADHD subtype.
  LF/HF however was higher in ADHD during both rest and sustained attention conditions,
  particularly in male children. Sustained attention was impaired in ADHD relative
  to controls, and a higher LF/HF ratio during sustained attention was associated
  with poorer performance in both groups. Lower rMSSD and HFA were associated with
  higher anxiety, oppositional behaviors and social problems, supporting prevailing
  theories that these measures index emotion regulation and adaptive social behavior.
  Different measures of heart rate variability provide important insights into the
  sustained attention and emotional and behavioral regulation impairments observed
  in ADHD and may aid in delineating ADHD pathophysiology.'
