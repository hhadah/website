abstract: Little is known about how intranasally administered oxytocin reaches the
  brain and modulates social behavior and cognition. Pupil dilation is a sensitive
  index of attentional allocation and effort, and inter-individual variability in
  pupil diameter during performance of social-cognitive tasks may provide a better
  assessment of pharmacological effects on the brain than behavioral measures. Here,
  we leverage the close relationship between pupil and neural activity to inform our
  understanding of nose-to-brain oxytocin routes and possible dose-response relationships.
  To this end, we assessed pupil diameter data from a previously reported functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study under four treatment conditions-including
  two different doses of intranasal oxytocin using a novel Breath Powered nasal device,
  intravenous (IV) oxytocin, and placebo-and investigated the association with amygdala
  activation in response to emotional stimuli. The study used a randomized, double-blind,
  double-dummy, crossover design, with 16 healthy male adults administering a single-dose
  of these four treatments. A significant main effect of treatment condition on pupil
  diameter was observed. Posthoc tests revealed reduced pupil diameter after 8IU intranasal
  oxytocin compared to placebo, but no significant difference between 8IU intranasal
  oxytocin and either 24IU intranasal oxytocin or IV oxytocin treatment conditions.
  Analysis also showed a significant relationship between pupil diameter and right
  amygdala activation after 8IU intranasal oxytocin. Although there was no significant
  difference between 8IU intranasal oxytocin and IV oxytocin on right amygdala activity
  and pupil diameter, the significant difference between 8IU intranasal oxytocin and
  placebo is consistent with the hypothesis that oxytocin can travel to the brain
  via a nose-to-brain route.
