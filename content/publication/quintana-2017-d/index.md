abstract: 'Objective: The neuropeptides oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP)
  play important and interrelated roles in modulating mammalian social behaviour.
  While the OT system has received considerable research attention for its potential
  to treat psychiatric symptoms, comparatively little is known about the role of the
  AVP system in human social behaviour. To better understand the intraindividual stability
  of basal AVP, the present study assessed the reproducibility of basal plasma AVP
  concentrations.  Methods: Basal plasma AVP was assessed at four sampling points
  separated by 8 days, on average, in 16 healthy adult males.  Results: Only one out
  of six comparisons revealed strong evidence for reproducibility of basal AVP concentrations
  (visit 2 vs. visit 4: r=0.8, ptextless0.001; all other comparisons ptextgreater0.1).
  The concordance correlation coefficient [0.15, 95% CI (âˆ’0.55, 0.73)] also revealed
  poor overall reproducibility.  Conclusion: Poor reliability of basal AVP concentrations
  suggests future work covarying AVP with trait markers should proceed with careful
  consideration of intraindividual fluctuations.'
