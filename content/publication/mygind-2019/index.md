abstract: Contact with nature is widely considered to ameliorate psychological stress,
  but the empirical support for a causal link is limited. We conducted a systematic
  review to synthesize and critically assess the evidence. Six electronic databases
  were searched. Twenty-six studies evaluated the difference between the effect of
  natural environments and that of a suitable control on the acute psychophysiological
  stress response. Eighteen studies were rated as being of moderate quality, four
  studies of low quality, and four studies of high quality. Meta-analyses indicated
  that seated relaxation (g = .5, p = .06) and walking (g = .3, p = .02) in natural
  environments enhanced heart rate variability more than the same activities in control
  conditions. Cortisol concentration measures were inconsistent. While intuitively
  and theoretically sound, the empirical support for acute stress-reducing effects
  of immersion in natural environments is tentative due to small sample sizes and
  methodological weaknesses in the studies. We provide guidelines for future research.
