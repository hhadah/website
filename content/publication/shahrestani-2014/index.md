abstract: 'Background: The inability to regulate autonomic activity during social
  interactions is believed to contribute to social and emotional dysregulation in
  children. Research has employed heart rate variability (HRV) during both socially
  engaging and socially disengaging dyadic tasks between children and adults to assess
  this.  Methods: We conducted a meta‐analysis including evidence from 18 studies
  comprising 1,544 children who were categorized as either healthy or at risk/diagnosed
  with psychopathology. Within these groups, we assessed the impact of social engagement
  and disengagement tasks on HRV.  Results: Results showed that social engagement
  tasks left HRV unaltered to a baseline. Social disengagement, however, was associated
  with decreases in HRV. In a task that included disengagement and then engagement,
  HRV was reduced during disengagement but was then restored during the reunion phase
  (engagement). Children at risk or with a diagnosis for psychopathology, however,
  failed to show any change in HRV during dyadic social interaction tasks. This was
  despite a social stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test, causing significantly reduced
  HRV in both groups.  Conclusions: This meta‐analysis provides support to suggest
  HRV may provide a worthwhile context specific marker for the effective regulation
  of dyadic social interactions in children.'
