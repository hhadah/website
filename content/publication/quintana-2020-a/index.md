abstract: Open research data provide considerable scientific, societal, and economic
  benefits. However, disclosure risks can sometimes limit the sharing of open data,
  especially in datasets that include sensitive details or information from individuals
  with rare disorders. This article introduces the concept of synthetic datasets,
  which is an emerging method originally developed to permit the sharing of confidential
  census data. Synthetic datasets mimic real datasets by preserving their statistical
  properties and the relationships between variables. Importantly, this method also
  reduces disclosure risk to essentially nil as no record in the synthetic dataset
  represents a real individual. This practical guide with accompanying R script enables
  biobehavioural researchers to create synthetic datasets and assess their utility
  via the synthpop R package. By sharing synthetic datasets that mimic original datasets
  that could not otherwise be made open, researchers can ensure the reproducibility
  of their results and facilitate data exploration while maintaining participant privacy.
