abstract: "Background: Depression is associated with an increase in the likelihood\
  \ of cardiac events; however, studies investigating the relationship between depression\
  \ and heart rate variability (HRV) have generally focused on patients with cardiovascular\
  \ disease (CVD). The objective of the current report is to examine with meta-analysis\
  \ the impact of depression and antidepressant treatment on HRV in depressed patients\
  \ without CVD.  Methods: Studies comparing 1) HRV in patients with major depressive\
  \ disorder and healthy control subjects and 2) the HRV of patients with major depressive\
  \ disorder before and after treatment were considered for meta-analysis.  Results:\
  \ Meta-analyses were based on 18 articles that met inclusion criteria, comprising\
  \ a total of 673 depressed participants and 407 healthy comparison participants.\
  \ Participants with depression had lower HRV (time frequency: Hedges' g = −.301,\
  \ p textless .001; high frequency: Hedges' g = −.293, p textless .001; nonlinear:\
  \ Hedges' g = −1.955, p = .05; Valsalva ratio: Hedges' g = −.712, p textless .001)\
  \ than healthy control subjects, and depression severity was negatively correlated\
  \ with HRV (r = −.354, p textless .001). Tricyclic medication decreased HRV, although\
  \ serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, and nefazodone had no significant\
  \ impact on HRV despite patient response to treatment.  Conclusions: Depression\
  \ without CVD is associated with reduced HRV, which decreases with increasing depression\
  \ severity, most apparent with nonlinear measures of HRV. Critically, a variety\
  \ of antidepressant treatments do not resolve these decreases despite resolution\
  \ of symptoms, highlighting that antidepressant medications might not have HRV-mediated\
  \ cardioprotective effects and the need to identify individuals at risk among patients\
  \ in remission."
