abstract: Podcasts are emerging as a popular forum for discussing scientific life.
  Here, we describe how podcasts can benefit scientific communities by disseminating
  career-specific information that is often unwritten and unavailable to those outside
  academic social knowledge networks. We also provide practical advice on how scientists
  can launch their own podcasts.
