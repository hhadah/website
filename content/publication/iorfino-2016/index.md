abstract: 'The vagus nerve is a major constituent in the bidirectional relationship
  between the heart and the prefrontal cortex. This study investigated the role of
  the vagus in social cognition using the cold face test (facial cooling) to stimulate
  the vagus nerve and increase prefrontal inhibitory control. Heart Rate Variability
  (HRV) was measured to index parasympathetic outflow while social cognition ability
  was tested using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Healthy males (n
  = 25) completed the RMET under two conditions: with and without facial cooling.
  Results indicated that although facial cooling increased HRV at rest, there was
  no improvement in the RMET during the facial cooling condition. Interestingly, completing
  the RMET with facial cooling abolished this increase in HRV, suggesting interference
  along the vagal reflex arc. These results are consistent with the involvement of
  a common cortico-subcortical circuit in autonomic and cognitive processes, important
  for emotion recognition.'
