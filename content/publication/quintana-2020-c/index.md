abstract: Reports on the modulatory role of the neuropeptide oxytocin on social cognition
  and behavior have steadily increased over the last two decades, stimulating considerable
  interest in its psychiatric application. Basic and clinical research in humans primarily
  employs intranasal application protocols. This approach assumes that intranasal
  administration increases oxytocin levels in the central nervous system via a direct
  nose-to-brain route, which in turn acts upon centrally-located oxytocin receptors
  to exert its behavioral effects. However, debates have emerged on whether intranasally
  administered oxytocin enters the brain via the nose-to-brain route and whether this
  route leads to functionally relevant increases in central oxytocin levels. In this
  review we outline recent advances from human and animal research that provide converging
  evidence for functionally relevant effects of the intranasal oxytocin administration
  route, suggesting that direct nose-to-brain delivery underlies the behavioral effects
  of oxytocin on social cognition and behavior. Moreover, advances in previously debated
  methodological issues, such as pre-registration, reproducibility, statistical power,
  interpretation of non-significant results, dosage, and sex differences are discussed
  and integrated with suggestions for the next steps in translating intranasal oxytocin
  into psychiatric applications.
