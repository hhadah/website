abstract: Intranasal oxytocin (OXT) has been associated with effects on diverse social-emotional
  domains in humans, however progress towards a therapeutic application of OXT in
  disorders with social-emotion impairments is currently hampered by poor replicability.
  Limited statistical power and individual differences in biological factors, such
  as oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genetics, may have contributed to these variable findings.
  To this end, employing a validated oxytocin-sensitive trait judgment paradigm, we
  present a pharmaco-genetic study aiming at (1) replicating previous findings suggesting
  that intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) reduces the self-referential bias in a large sample
  of n = 170 male subjects, (2) determining whether variations in common receptor
  polymorphisms (rs237887, rs2268491, rs2254298, rs53576, rs2268498) influence sensitivity
  to oxytocin's behavioral effects. We confirmed that in the whole sample oxytocin
  influenced self-other distinction in terms of reduced decision time. However, oxytocin
  only influenced decision time in rs53576 G carriers, whereas effects on subsequent
  memory performance were only found in rs2268498 TT homozygotes. In summary, the
  current study partially replicates our previous findings showing that oxytocin reduces
  the self-referential bias and suggests that sensitivity to its effects in this domain
  are receptor genotype dependent.
