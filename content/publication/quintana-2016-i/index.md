abstract: Neuropeptides are small molecules that act as messengers between different
  brain regions. There are roughly 100 neuropeptides that are important for a variety
  of functions, including hunger, memory, and learning. Oxytocin is one such neuropeptide,
  playing a crucial role in childbirth and breastfeeding. More recently, oxytocin
  has been shown to be essential for our social behaviors. When given to people in
  the form of a nasal spray, oxytocin can change key aspects of social behavior, such
  as how well we can recognize emotions in others. As people with autism spectrum
  conditions have difficulties in how social information is understood and used, scientists
  have been testing oxytocin nasal spray as a potential treatment. But how does oxytocin
  nasal spray travel from the nose to the brain, and how does it change how we behave
  socially?
