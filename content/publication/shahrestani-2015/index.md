abstract: Social interaction skill is important for psychological wellbeing, stress
  regulation, protection from disability and overall life satisfaction. Increase in
  activity of the vagus nerve, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), is associated
  with social interaction skill and decreased stress. In this meta-analysis we collated
  statistics from thirteen studies consisting of 787 participants who were participating
  in social interactions while HRV was simultaneously collected. Results revealed
  that while dyadic social interactions do not increase HRV generally from a baseline
  state, negative dyadic social interactions decrease HRV in a manner similar to the
  Trier Social Stress Task. Further, participants with psychopathology do not show
  cardiac autonomic flexibility during social interactions as indicated by reductions
  under stress and increases with subsequently positive social interactions. The role
  of age, gender and HRV index were also examined as potential moderators of HRV.
  Implications for health and wellbeing resulting from exposure to negative social
  interactions are discussed.
