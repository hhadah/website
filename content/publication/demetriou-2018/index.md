abstract: Evidence of executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) across
  development remains mixed and establishing its role is critical for guiding diagnosis
  and intervention. The primary objectives of this meta-analysis is to analyse executive
  function (EF) performance in ASD, the fractionation across EF subdomains, the clinical
  utility of EF measures and the influence of multiple moderators (for example, age,
  gender, diagnosis, measure characteristics). The Embase, Medline and PsychINFO databases
  were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies published since the inclusion of
  Autism in DSM-III (1980) up to end of June 2016 that compared EF in ASD with neurotypical
  controls. A random-effects model was used and moderators were tested using subgroup
  analysis. The primary outcome measure was Hedges’ g effect size for EF and moderator
  factors. Clinical sensitivity was determined by the overlap percentage statistic
  (OL%). Results were reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items
  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 235 studies comprising
  14 081 participants were included (N, ASD=6816, Control=7265). A moderate overall
  effect size for reduced EF (Hedges’ g=0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43–0.53)
  was found with similar effect sizes across each domain. The majority of moderator
  comparisons were not significant although the overall effect of executive dysfunction
  has gradually reduced since the introduction of ASD. Only a small number of EF measures
  achieved clinical sensitivity. This study confirms a broad executive dysfunction
  in ASD that is relatively stable across development. The fractionation of executive
  dysfunction into individual subdomains was not supported, nor was diagnostic sensitivity.
  Development of feasible EF measures focussing on clinical sensitivity for diagnosis
  and treatment studies should be a priority.
