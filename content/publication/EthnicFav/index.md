abstract: In this poject, I investigate the existance of ethic favoritism in 21 sub-Saharan African countries using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). I also try to explore how democratic institutions, through checks and balances, affect ethnic favoritism. I found that ethnic favoritism exists in education, electrification, infant mortality, and wealth. Moreover, democratic institutions curb ethnic favoritism in the continent.
