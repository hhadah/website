abstract: Reduced cardiac autonomic function is associated with increased risk of
  cardiovascular disease (CVD), with heart rate variability (HRV) providing an accessible
  index of cardiac autonomic function. HRV may provide a candidate physiological mechanism
  linking reduced cardiac autonomic function to increased risk for CVD in schizophrenia
  illness. This study examines whether HRV is also reduced in a community sample of
  treatment-seeking participants experiencing early psychosis (n = 48) compared to
  healthy volunteers (n = 48) and social anxiety control groups (n = 48) matched by
  gender and age. HRV was assessed during a five-minute interbeat interval recording
  at rest. Participants also completed self-report psychiatric symptom measures. Early
  psychosis participants showed significant reductions in HRV compared to social anxiety
  and healthy control groups. Reductions in HRV were also observed in early psychosis
  participants taking anticholinergic medications compared to both control groups
  taking cardio-benign medications or who were non-medicated. Lastly, whether or not
  early psychosis participants were taking anticholinergic medications was not associated
  with reductions in HRV. Findings provide preliminary evidence that early psychosis
  is associated with reduced HRV. This study supports further research with larger
  sample sizes to precisely determine the influence of anticholinergic drugs on HRV
  in early psychosis populations.
