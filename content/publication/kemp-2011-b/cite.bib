 abstract = {We were most interested to read the recent report by Licht et al. (1) on the impact
of a variety of antidepressants on heart rate variability (HRV), a robust predictor
of sudden cardiac death and future mortality. Longitudinal evidence was reported for
the effects of antidepressants including tricyclics (TCAs), serotonergic and noradrenaline
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on HRV.
New users of TCAs (n = 12) displayed a decrease in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)
(an indicator of HRV that controls for respiration rate) of 23 msec over the 2-year
assessment period; new users of SNRIs (n = 23) displayed a decrease of 12 msec; and
new users of SSRIs (n = 74) displayed a decrease of 7 msec, compared with persistent
non-users of medication.},
