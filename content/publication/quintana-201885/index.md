abstract: Oxytocin plays an important role in social behavior. Thus, there has been
  significant research interest for the role of the oxytocin system in several psychiatric
  disorders, and the potential of intranasal oxytocin administration to treat social
  dysfunction. Measurement of oxytocin concentrations in saliva are sometimes used
  to approximate peripheral levels of oxytocin; however, the validity of this approach
  is unclear. In this study, saliva and plasma oxytocin was assessed after two doses
  of Exhalation Delivery System delivered intranasal oxytocin (8 IU and 24 IU), intravenous
  oxytocin (1 IU) and placebo in a double-dummy, within-subjects design with men.
  We found that intranasal oxytocin (8 IU and 24 IU) administration increased saliva
  oxytocin concentrations in comparison to saliva oxytocin concentration levels after
  intravenous and placebo administration. Additionally, we found that saliva oxytocin
  concentrations were not significantly associated with plasma oxytocin concentrations
  after either intranasal or intravenous oxytocin administration. Altogether, we suggest
  that saliva oxytocin concentrations do not accurately index peripheral oxytocin
  after intranasal or intravenous oxytocin administration, at least in men. The data
  indicates that elevated oxytocin saliva levels after nasal delivery primarily reflect
  exogenous administered oxytocin that is cleared from the nasal cavity to the oropharynx,
  and is therefore a weak surrogate for peripheral blood measurements.
