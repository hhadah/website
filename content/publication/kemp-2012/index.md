abstract: 'Context: Oxytocin (OT) plays a key regulatory role in human social behaviour.
  While prior studies have examined the effects of OT on observable social behaviours,
  studies have seldom examined the effects of OT on psychophysiological markers such
  as heart rate variability (HRV), which provides an index of individualâ€™s motivation
  for social behaviour. Furthermore, no studies have examined the impact of OT on
  HRV under resting conditions, which provides an index of maximal capacity for social
  engagement.  Objective: To examine the effects of OT on HRV measures in healthy
  male participants while at rest. OT was hypothesised to increase HRV, compared to
  placebo, and that the effects would be greatest for a non-linear measure of HRV
  (the detrended fluctuation scaling exponent).  Methods: Twenty-one male participants
  were recruited for this study. Participants were non-smokers, not on any medications
  and reported no history of psychiatric illness, neurological disorder, or any other
  serious medical condition (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease). The study employed
  a randomised, placebo-controlled, within-subject, crossover, experimental design.  Main
  Outcome Measures: HRV was calculated from electrocardiography under a standardized,
  10-minute, resting state condition.  Results: As hypothesised, OT increased HRV
  and these effects were largest using the detrended fluctuation scaling exponent,
  a non-linear measure. These changes were observed in the absence of any change in
  state mood, as measured by the profile of mood states. Importantly, participants
  were unable to correctly guess which treatment they had been assigned at either
  of the two assessments.  Conclusions: Together with the broader literature on OT
  and HRV, findings suggest that acute administration of OT may facilitate a fundamental
  psychophysiological feature of social behaviour, increasing capacity for social
  engagement. Findings also suggest that HRV changes may provide a novel biomarker
  of response to OT nasal spray that can be incorporated into research on response
  to treatment.'
