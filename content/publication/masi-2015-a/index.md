abstract: The role of non-diagnostic features in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum
  disorders (ASDs) is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests immune system alterations
  in ASD may be implicated in the severity of behavioral impairment and other developmental
  outcomes. The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate if there
  is a characteristic abnormal cytokine profile in ASD compared with healthy controls
  (HCs). We identified relevant studies following a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
  Web of Knowledge and Scopus. A meta-analysis was performed on studies comparing
  plasma and serum concentrations of cytokines in unmedicated participants with ASD
  and HCs. Results were reported according to PRISMA statement. Seventeen studies
  with a total sample size of 743 participants with ASD and 592 HC were included in
  the analysis. Nineteen cytokines were assessed. Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta
  (Ptextless0.001), IL-6 (P=0.03), IL-8 (P=0.04), interferon-gamma (P=0.02), eotaxin
  (P=0.01) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Ptextless0.05) were significantly higher
  in the participants with ASD compared with the HC group, while concentrations of
  transforming growth factor-Î²1 were significantly lower (Ptextless0.001). There were
  no significant differences between ASD participants and controls for the other 12
  cytokines analyzed. The findings of our meta-analysis identified significantly altered
  concentrations of cytokines in ASD compared to HCs, strengthening evidence of an
  abnormal cytokine profile in ASD where inflammatory signals dominate.
