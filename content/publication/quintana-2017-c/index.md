abstract: 'Heart rate variability (HRV) has become an increasingly popular index of
  cardiac autonomic control in the biobehavioral sciences due to its relationship
  with mental illness and cognitive traits. However, the intraindividual stability
  of HRV in response to sleep and diurnal disturbances, which are commonly reported
  in mental illness, and its relationship with executive function are not well understood.
  Here, in 40 healthy adult males we calculated high frequency HRV—an index of parasympathetic
  nervous system (PNS) activity—using pulse oximetry during brain imaging, and assessed
  attentional and executive function performance in a subsequent behavioral test session
  at three time points: morning, evening, and the following morning. Twenty participants
  were randomly selected for total sleep deprivation whereas the other 20 participants
  slept as normal. Sleep deprivation and morning-to-night variation did not influence
  high frequency HRV at either a group or individual level; however, sleep deprivation
  abolished the relationship between orienting attention performance and HRV. We conclude
  that a day of wake and a night of laboratory-induced sleep deprivation do not alter
  supine high frequency HRV in young healthy male adults.'
