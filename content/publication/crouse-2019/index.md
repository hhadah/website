abstract: The relationship between substance misuse and psychosis is markedly complex,
  with negative impacts of substance use on physical health, behavior, psychiatric
  symptoms, and brain function. Few studies have focussed on the direct links between
  substance misuse and social cognitive functioning in psychosis. However, substance
  use may affect social cognition through multiple indirect paths, for instance, through
  early sensory processing (e.g., mismatch negativity) and autonomic nervous system
  regulation (e.g., heart rate variability (HRV)). These indirect paths may represent
  “low level” effects which may lead to upstream disruptions to social cognitive processes.
  Here, we first summarize the literature reporting direct associations between substance
  misuse and social cognition in psychosis, and then address potential indirect links
  between substance use and social cognition involving preattentional sensory processing
  and HRV. We conclude with a bottom-up framework linking these factors and suggest
  avenues for future investigation.
