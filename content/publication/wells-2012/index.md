abstract: 'Background: Musical performance is a skilled activity performed under intense
  pressure, thus is often a profound source of anxiety. In other contexts, anxiety
  and its concomitant symptoms of sympathetic nervous system arousal have been successfully
  ameliorated with HRV biofeedback (HRV BF), a technique involving slow breathing
  which augments autonomic and emotional regulatory capacity. Objective: This randomised-controlled
  study explored the impact of a single 30-minute session of HRV BF on anxiety in
  response to a highly stressful music performance.  Methods: A total of 46 trained
  musicians participated in this study and were randomly allocated to a slow breathing
  with or without biofeedback or no-treatment control group. A 3 Group×2 Time mixed
  experimental design was employed to compare the effect of group before and after
  intervention on performance anxiety (STAI-S) and frequency domain measures of HRV.  Results:
  Slow breathing groups (n = 30) showed significantly greater improvements in high
  frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio measures of HRV relative to control (n = 15) during
  5 minute recordings of performance anticipation following the intervention (effect
  size: η2 = 0.122 and η2 = 0.116, respectively). The addition of biofeedback to a
  slow breathing protocol did not produce differential results. While intervention
  groups did not exhibit an overall reduction in self-reported anxiety, participants
  with high baseline anxiety who received the intervention (n = 15) displayed greater
  reductions in self-reported state anxiety relative to those in the control condition
  (n = 7) (r = 0.379).  Conclusions: These findings indicate that a single session
  of slow breathing, regardless of biofeedback, is sufficient for controlling physiological
  arousal in anticipation of psychosocial stress associated with music performance
  and that slow breathing is particularly helpful for musicians with high levels of
  anxiety. Future research is needed to further examine the effects of HRV BF as a
  low-cost, non-pharmacological treatment for music performance anxiety.'
