 abstract = {There is an opportunity for sports medicine to progress research ideation using synthetic datasets, maintaining research momentum when data collection is not feasible. These processes maximise the potential for application of open science practice, while retaining the commitment to privacy and ethics. Synthetic data could lead to more sustainable use of data, particularly in the form of hypothesis generation through exploratory research applied to synthetic datasets.},
