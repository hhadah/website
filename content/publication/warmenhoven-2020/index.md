abstract: There is an opportunity for sports medicine to progress research ideation
  using synthetic datasets, maintaining research momentum when data collection is
  not feasible. These processes maximise the potential for application of open science
  practice, while retaining the commitment to privacy and ethics. Synthetic data could
  lead to more sustainable use of data, particularly in the form of hypothesis generation
  through exploratory research applied to synthetic datasets.
