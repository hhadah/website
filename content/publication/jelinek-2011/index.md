abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in patients with Major Depressive
  Disorder (MDD). We examined the sensitivity of a new nonlinear parameter, the Complex
  Correlation Measure (CCM) in patients with depression. Two-minute ECG recordings
  at rest with eyes-closed were analyzed. CCM was higher (0.36±0.1) in control participants
  compared to MDD (0.29±0.1), indicating a decrease in temporal variability associated
  with decreased parasympathetic function (Cohen's d = 0.7, p=0.0008). CCM also demonstrated
  a larger effect size than SD1 (Cohen's d = 0.5, p =0.0005) and SD2 (Cohen's d =
  0.2, p = 0.015). These results highlight that depressed patients display a dampening
  of oscillations between parasympathetic and sympathetic input indicative of reduced
  functionality and increased risk of sudden cardiac death. CCM is a more sensitive
  measure of HRV, which provides additional information on HRV dynamics compared to
  SD1 and SD2 of the Poincaré plot distribution.
