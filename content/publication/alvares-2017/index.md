abstract: Extensive research efforts in the last decade have been expended into understanding
  whether intranasal oxytocin may be an effective therapeutic in treating social communication
  impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After much hyped
  early findings, subsequent clinical trials of longer-term administration have yielded
  more conservative and mixed evidence. However, it is still unclear at this stage
  whether these more disappointing findings reflect a true null effect or are mitigated
  by methodological differences masking true effects. In this review, we comprehensively
  evaluate the rationale for oxytocin as a therapeutic, evaluating evidence from randomized
  controlled trials, case reports, and open-label studies of oxytocin administration
  in individuals with ASD. The evidence to date, including reviews of preregistered
  trials, suggests a number of critical considerations for the design and interpretation
  of research in this area. These include considering the choice of ASD outcome measures,
  dosing and nasal spray device issues, and participant selection. Despite these limitations
  in the field to date, there remains significant potential for oxytocin to ameliorate
  aspects of the persistent and debilitating social impairments in individuals with
  ASD. Given the considerable media hype around new treatments for ASD, as well as
  the needs of eager families, there is an urgent need for researchers to prioritise
  considering such factors when conducting well-designed and controlled studies to
  further advance this field.
