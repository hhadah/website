abstract: 'Background: To determine the impact of specialized treatments, relative
  to comparator treatments, upon the weight and psychological symptoms of anorexia
  nervosa (AN) at end-of-treatment (EOT) and follow-up.  Methods: Randomized controlled
  trials (RCTs) between January 1980 and December 2017 that reported the effects of
  at least two treatments on AN were screened. Weight and psychological symptoms were
  analyzed separately for each study. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
  Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed, and studies were assessed using
  the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria
  and Cochrane risk of bias tool.  Results: We identified 35 eligible RCTs, comprising
  data from 2524 patients. Meta-analyses revealed a significant treatment effect on
  weight outcomes at EOT [g = 0.16, 95% CI (0.05–0.28), p = 0.006], but not at follow-up
  [g = 0.11, 95% CI (−0.04 to 0.27), p = 0.15]. There was no significant treatment
  effect on psychological outcomes at either EOT [g = −0.03, 95% CI (−0.14 to 0.08),
  p = 0.63], or follow-up [g = −0.001, 95% CI (−0.11 to 0.11), p = 0.98]. There was
  no strong evidence of publication bias or significant moderator effects for illness
  duration, mean age, year of publication, comparator group category, or risk of bias
  (all p values textgreater 0.05).  Conclusions: Current specialized treatments are
  more adept than comparator interventions at imparting change in weight-based AN
  symptoms at EOT, but not at follow-up. Specialized treatments confer no advantage
  over comparator interventions in terms of psychological symptoms. Future precision
  treatment efforts require a specific focus on the psychological symptoms of AN.'
