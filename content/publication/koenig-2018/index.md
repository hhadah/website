abstract: 'Understanding the association between autonomic nervous system [ANS] function
  and brain morphology across the lifespan provides important insights into neurovisceral
  mechanisms underlying health and disease. Resting state ANS activity, indexed by
  measures of heart rate [HR] and its variability [HRV] has been associated with brain
  morphology, particularly cortical thickness [CT]. While findings have been mixed
  regarding the anatomical distribution and direction of the associations, these inconsistencies
  may be due to sex and age differences in HR/HRV and CT. Previous studies have been
  limited by small sample sizes, which impede the assessment of sex differences and
  aging effects on the association between ANS function and CT. To overcome these
  limitations, 20 groups worldwide contributed data collected under similar protocols
  of CT assessment and HR/HRV recording to be pooled in a mega-analysis (N = 1,218
  (50.5% female), mean age 36.7 years (range: 12-87)). Findings suggest that the decline
  in HRV with increasing age is related to a decline in prefrontal CT, particularly
  in the orbitofrontal cortex. These effects were independent of sex and specific
  to HRV; with no significant association between CT and HR. Greater CT across the
  adult lifespan may be vital for the maintenance of healthy cardiac regulation via
  the ANS. Nonetheless, in the absence of longitudinal data, alternative explanations
  need to be considered. Findings reveal an important association between cortical
  thickness and cardiac parasympathetic activity with implications for healthy aging
  and longevity.'
