abstract: 'Background: The deviation between chronological age and age predicted using
  brain MRI is a putative marker of brain health and disease-related deterioration.
  Age prediction based on structural MRI data shows high accuracy and sensitivity
  to common brain disorders. However, brain aging is complex and heterogenous, both
  in terms of individual differences and the biological processes involved. Here,
  we implemented a multimodal age prediction approach and tested the predictive value
  across patients with a range of disorders with distinct etiologies and clinical
  features.   Methods: We implemented a multimodal model to estimate brain age using
  different combinations of cortical area, thickness and sub-cortical volumes, cortical
  and subcortical T1/T2-weighted ratios, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculated
  from functional arterial spin labeling (ASL) data. For each of the 11 models we
  assessed the age prediction accuracy in HC n=761 and compared the resulting brain
  age gaps (BAGs) between each clinical group and age-matched subsets of HC in patients
  with Alzheimer9s disease (AD, n=54), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=88), subjective
  cognitive impairment (SCI, n=55), schizophrenia (SZ, n=156), bipolar disorder (BD,
  n=136), autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=28).   Results: Among the 11 models, we
  found highest age prediction accuracy in HC when integrating all modalities (mean
  absolute error=6.5 years). Beyond this global BAG, the area under the curve for
  the receiver-operating characteristics based on two-group case-control classifications
  showed strongest effects for AD and ASD in global T1-weighted BAG (T1w-BAG), while
  MCI, SCI, BD and SZ showed strongest effects in CBF-based BAGs.   Conclusions: Combining
  multiple MRI modalities improves brain age prediction and reveals distinct deviations
  in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders. The multimodal BAG was
  most accurate in predicting age in HC, while group differences between patients
  and controls were often larger for BAGs based on single modalities. These findings
  demonstrate that multidimensional phenotyping provides a mapping of overlapping
  and distinct pathophysiology in common disorders of the brain, and specifically
  suggest metabolic and neurovascular aberrations in SZ and at-risk and early stage
  dementia.'
