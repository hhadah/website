abstract: The development of creativity in young children has been studied extensively,
  but relatively few studies have examined the period of adolescence and emerging
  adulthood in relation to creative potential.  The present study employs a combination
  of frequentist and Bayesian analyses to evaluate the impact of individual factors
  (e.g., IQ) and contextual factors (e.g., pursuit of creative hobbies) on creative
  ideation in three cohorts of young people aged 14-20 years.  Measures of divergent
  thinking, specifically the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and the Overcoming Knowledge
  Constraints Task, were used to this end.  Openness to aesthetic and imaginative
  experience was the strongest predictor of creative potential for the three AUT measures.
  Moreover, Bayesian hypothesis testing revealed that the best predictive model for
  AUT ideational fluency and AUT overall originality was one that included only Openness,
  whereas the best predictive model for AUT peak originality, or the propensity to
  generate highly original responses, included Openness, as well as IQ and Engagement
  in Creative Hobbies.  No group differences in creative potential were found between
  the three age cohorts (aged 14-15, 16-17, and 18-20).  The study not only confirms
  the importance of openness to aesthetic and imaginative experience as a predictor
  of creative potential in adolescents and young adults, but also indicates the necessity
  to consider the combined and differentiated impact of individual and contextual
  factors in different facets of creative ideation.
