abstract: 'Background: Research examining the effects of oxytocin (OT) interventions
  on psychiatric, social-behavioral, and social-cognitive outcomes regularly collect
  peripheral levels of OT as markers of central bioavailability. Such inferences rest
  on the assumption that central and peripheral levels of OT are directly associated.
  However, conflicting evidence from coordinated sampling of central and peripheral
  OT question the validity of this assumption. The purpose of this meta-analysis is
  to evaluate the correlation between central and peripheral OT, as well as to account
  for potential heterogeneity in the literature.  Methods/design: Studies that report
  coordinated sampling of central and peripheral OT in humans and animals will be
  identified. Research investigating concentrations in both basal states and after
  exogenous administration will be considered. PubMed and Embase databases will be
  searched, along with citation lists of retrieved articles. Peer-reviewed studies
  written in English published from 1971 onwards will be included in the meta-analysis.
  Data will be extracted from eligible studies for a random-effects meta-analysis.
  For each study, a summary effect size, heterogeneity, risk of bias, publication
  bias, and the effect of categorical and continuous moderator variables will be determined.  Discussion:
  This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify and synthesize evidence to
  determine if there is an association between central and peripheral OT concentrations.
  If significant associations are observed, evidence would provide a rationale for
  future research to use peripheral measures as a proxy for central OT concentrations.'
