abstract: There is growing interest in the role of the oxytocin system in social cognition
  and behavior. Peripheral oxytocin concentrations are regularly used to approximate
  central concentrations in psychiatric research, however, the validity of this approach
  is unclear. Here we conducted a pre-registered systematic search and meta-analysis
  of correlations between central and peripheral oxytocin concentrations. A search
  of databases yielded 17 eligible studies, resulting in a total sample size of 516
  participants and subjects. Overall, a positive association between central and peripheral
  oxytocin concentrations was revealed [r=0.29, 95% CI (0.14, 0.42), ptextless0.0001].
  This association was moderated by experimental context [Qb(4), p=0.003]. While no
  association was observed under basal conditions (r=0.08, p=0.31), significant associations
  were observed after intranasal oxytocin administration (r=0.66, ptextless0.0001),
  and after experimentally induced stress (r=0.49, p=0.001). These results indicate
  a coordination of central and peripheral oxytocin release after stress and after
  intranasal administration. Although popular, the approach of using peripheral oxytocin
  levels to approximate central levels under basal conditions is not supported by
  the present results.
