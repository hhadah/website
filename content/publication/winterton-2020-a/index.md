abstract: A growing number of studies suggest that social isolation and loneliness
  are associated with premature mortality and are more prevalent among people with
  mental illness than in the general population, outlining many potential paths to
  disease still to be elucidated. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine
  the relationship between loneliness, social isolation, and established cardiovascular/metabolic
  risk factors and disorders, especially in severe mental illness, and to account
  for potential heterogeneity in the literature.
