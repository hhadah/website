abstract: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in boys is nearly four
  times higher than in girls, and the causes of this sex difference are not fully
  known. Difficulties in executive function may be involved in development of autistic
  symptomatology. Here we investigated sex differences in the relationship between
  executive function in everyday life and social dysfunction symptoms in a sample
  of 116 children (25 girls) aged 5-19 years with IQ above 70 and with a diagnosis
  of ASD. They were assessed with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
  (BRIEF) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R). We found no significant
  differences in BRIEF or ADI-R scores between girls and boys after correcting for
  multiple testing. Nested linear regression models revealed significant sex differences
  in the relationship between executive function and both reciprocal social interaction
  and communication over and above the main effects of age, sex, IQ and comorbid attention
  deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis. We did not find sex differences in the
  relationship between executive dysfunction and restricted and repetitive behaviors.
  Altogether, our results provide a greater understanding of the sex-specific characteristics
  of ASD and may suggest that boys and girls can benefit from different intervention
  strategies.
