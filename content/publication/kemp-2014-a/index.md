abstract: 'Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with increased
  heart rate and reductions in its variability (HRV) – markers of future morbidity
  and mortality – yet prior studies have reported contradictory effects. We hypothesised
  that increases in heart rate and reductions in HRV would be more robust in melancholia
  relative to controls, than in patients with non-melancholia.   Methods: A total
  of 72 patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD (age M: 36.26, SE: 1.34; 42 females)
  and 94 controls (age M: 35.69, SE: 1.16; 52 females) were included in this study.
  Heart rate and measures of its variability (HRV) were calculated from two 2-minute
  electrocardiogram recordings during resting state. Propensity score matching controlled
  imbalance on potential confounds between patients with melancholia (n=40) and non-melancholia
  (n=32) including age, gender, disorder severity and comorbid anxiety disorders.   Results:
  MDD patients with melancholia displayed significantly increased heart rate and lower
  resting-state HRV (including the square root of the mean squared differences between
  successive N–N intervals, the absolute power of high frequency and standard deviation
  of the Poincaré plot perpendicular to the line of identity measures of HRV) relative
  to controls, findings associated with a moderate effect size (Cohens d’s = 0.56-0.58).
  Patients with melancholia also displayed an increased heart rate relative to those
  with non-melancholia (Cohen’s d = 0.20).   Conclusion: MDD patients with melancholia
  – but not non-melancholia – display robust increases in heart rate and decreases
  in HRV. These findings may underpin a variety of behavioural impairments in patients
  with melancholia including somatic symptoms, cognitive impairment, reduced responsiveness
  to the environment, and over the longer-term, morbidity and mortality.'
