abstract: "Aim: Research into Theory of Mind (ToM) in alcohol use disorder (AUD) is\
  \ sparse and the extant findings contradictory. The objective of this paper was\
  \ to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether individuals with AUD show ToM\
  \ deficits across the available published literature.  Method: A comprehensive literature\
  \ search was performed with the PsychInfo, PubMed and Web Science databases for\
  \ studies from 1990 to March 2015, pairing the keywords 'alcohol' and 'theory of\
  \ mind'. Results were filtered and eight studies met the inclusion criteria and\
  \ were included in the final meta-analysis.  Results: Results showed that individuals\
  \ with AUD (n = 187) displayed reduced ToM compared to controls (n = 187). Hedges'\
  \ g was -1.62 [(-2.28, -0.96), SE = 0.66, P textless 0.01], which is indicative\
  \ of a large effect size. The percentage of males had a significant impact on the\
  \ effect size, Q = 7.90, P = 0.005, while IQ and level of education did not.  Conclusions:\
  \ Results of this study suggest that AUD may be associated with impaired understanding\
  \ of others' intentions and emotions, which can leave an individual vulnerable to\
  \ misinterpreting social cues. Clinical care implications of the findings, limitations\
  \ of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed."
