abstract: 'Background: The combination of eating disorder (ED) and the experience
  of childhood trauma leads to significant impairment and suffering. To improve treatment,
  it is critically important to study treatment effects and the mechanism of these
  effects. The overall aim of the current project is; (1) to build knowledge on how
  to best treat patients with ED with and without childhood trauma, (2) to develop
  our understanding about how change happens for these patients. We will do this by
  comparing two treatment models; (1) Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) and (2) Cognitive-Behavioural
  Therapy (CBT) for ED. This paper describes the development, design and implementation
  of the trial.   Methods/design: Patients included in this randomized controlled
  trial will satisfy DSM-5 criteria for ED and approximately half of the patients
  will in addition have a history of childhood trauma. A total of 144 patients who
  have received either CFT or CBT are followed up one year after completion of the
  treatment. The study will collect a rich dataset of outcome measures at four time
  points, and process, sub-outcome and neurobiological measures at 13 time points.
  All patients will be assessed with the same clinical instruments based on current
  state-of-the-art methods. The primary outcome will be percentage of recovery of
  ED, while secondary outcomes will relate to treatment effects on trauma symptoms,
  general symptoms and quality of life.   Discussion: This trial will make an important
  contribution to the need for evidence of effective treatment for patients with ED
  with or without childhood trauma.'
