abstract: 'Objective: Treatment outcomes for anorexia nervosa (AN) remain modest,
  and recent research suggests that clinical trials may be of limited methodological
  quality. With increasing evidence illustrating the irreproducibility of psychological
  research, no research to date has systematically examined the cumulative effect
  of bias in research relating to the treatment of AN.   Method: We identified all
  AN trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov between 2000 and 2018 and examined rates
  of (a) the noncompletion of clinical trials, the (b) nonpublication of trials once
  listed as completed, (c) the nonprospective registration of clinical trials, and
  (d) the nonreplication of findings.   Results: We note that of 201 trials listed
  on ClinicalTrials.gov, only 101 have been completed, and of those, only 41 have
  been published. Moreover, of these 41 published trials, only eight demonstrated
  evidence of prospective trial registration, and only seven have had their primary
  findings replicated in other studies.   Discussion: These results illustrate the
  profound cumulative effect of methodological bias in registered trials for AN, which
  may have a significant impact both on what appears in the current evidence base,
  and on the reproducibility of studies comprising this evidence base.'
