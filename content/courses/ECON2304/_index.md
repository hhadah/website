## Course Overview: 

This course is an introduction to microeconomics - individual consumer and firm behavior, supply and demand and the market determination or prices, production, and income. It also includes government price ceilings, monopoly and antitrust, market failures and environmental pollution.

## Learning Outcomes:

-	Students will understand market failure and externalities as well as the effects of government intervention in such markets
-	Students will be able to apply economic reasoning to better understand real world policy issues, such as tax system design, poverty, and discrimination 
Prerequisites: Completion of Math 1310 or a higher Math. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites.

## Course Requirements: 

#### Grading

-	4 Semester Exams 70%
-	Online MindTap Assignments 30%	
-	Essay (extra-credit) 3%		
-	End of semester evaluations	2% (If more than 80% of the students filled out the evaluation the class will get a 1%, if more than 90% did all of you will get 2%)  
Total 105%  

## Exams

There will be 4 exams during the semester. There is no make-up exam unless a student has been involved in an accident (proof from the police) or has been seriously ill and shows proof from the doctor/hospital.  Unapproved absence from any exam counts as a zero. It is the professor’s decision whether the student can take the exam, after showing the required proof. Contact me ASAP before/after a missed exam and we can discuss options. The final comprehensive exam is scheduled for Tuesday, May 10 from 5 to 8 PM.  

## Homework

Grades are not negotiable. Observance of all due dates and times is the responsibility of the student. MindTap assignments are due each Sunday at 11:45 pm. It is never wise to start working on your assignment 15 minutes before the deadline - you may fail to submit it on-time. Aim to submit your assignments at least 30 minutes prior to the deadline.


## Essay Assignment: 

To pass this class you are required to submit a short paper (about 250 – 400 words) 

You are required to pick a consumer product and discuss the followings:
1.       What is the product? [Hint: this can be as broad as you want, like computers, TVs, cars or as brand specific as possible, such as Twinkles, iphone. Think about how you will answer the questions below before you pick your product]. 
2.       What are the substitutes and complements for this product?
3.       Is the price elasticity of demand greater or below 1? In other words, how sensitive are the consumers to this price change in this product? [Hint: best to be support by news article, news report, financial report, journal articles. If you do have support, please add proper citations and bibliography section] 
4.       Is this product a normal good, inferior good? Why?
5.       Describe the market competition for this product (perfect competition, oligopoly, monopoly, etc) Who are the main producers? 
6.       What factors would affect the demand for this product? 
7.       What factors would affect the supply for this product? What inputs does it require?
A more detailed outline is available under the Course Materials in your MindTap account. 

I follow the standard grading scale (93-100 is A, 90-92 is A-, 87-89 is B+ and so on).  However, there may be an adjustment (curve) of the grade distribution at the end of the semester.  

## Student hours: 

If there are things you do not understand you should come to me for help. You must bring both your class notes as well as the notes you take while reading your textbook and show me specific questions or concepts you are struggling with. The course is, by nature, comprehensive, and poor performance early on will lead to poor performance throughout the semester. Thus, it is a good idea to study consistently and read assigned chapters from your textbook before the class.

## Excused Absence Policy
Regular class attendance, participation, and engagement in coursework are important contributors to student success. Absences may be excused as provided in the University of Houston Undergraduate Excused Absence Policy for reasons including: medical illness of student or close relative, death of a close family member, legal or government proceeding that a student is obligated to attend, recognized professional and educational activities where the student is presenting, and University-sponsored activity or athletic competition. Under these policies, students with excused absences will be provided with an opportunity to make up any quiz, exam or other work that contributes to the course grade or a satisfactory alternative. Please read the full policy for details regarding reasons for excused absences, the approval process, and extended absences. Additional policies address absences related to military service, religious holy days, pregnancy and related conditions, and disability.

## Incompletes
The official policy on incompletes, from the Undergraduate Catalog, states that the grade of “I” is given “when students a) are currently passing a course or b) still have a reasonable hope of passing in the judgment of the instructor, but for non-academic reasons beyond their control have not completed a relatively small part of all requirements.” A student with an F average who would have to get a 100 on the final to pass does not have a “reasonable hope” of passing; a student who has already missed exams or papers and is also unable to take the final exam or complete a final paper is NOT missing only a “relatively small part” of the requirements. Finally, having a lot of work to do is not a “non-academic” reason beyond the student's control.
