# Research Questions

<h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Does a person benefit from having a co-ethnic ruler in power?</li>
  </ul>
</h2>

<h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Does a change in a country's political system—democracy to dictatorship and <em>vice versa</em>—affect ethnic favoritism?</li>
  </ul>
</h2>

# Motivation
<ul>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->"> <!--<strong>-->Ethnic favoritism has been widespread in Africa and it negatively affects growth (La Porta et al., 1999; Alesina, Baqir and Easterly, 1999; Alesina et al., 2003; Alesina and Zhuravskaya, 2011)</li>
    </br>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->">Ethnic diversity also affects the productivity of labor (Lazear, 1999; Habyarimana et al., 2007; Hjort, 2014)</li>
    </br>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->">Investigating the effect of democracy on ethnic favoritism is important</li>
    </br>
    <li style="font-size:25px; <!--font-weight: bold;-->">According to the Congressional Research Service</strong> (Husted et al., 2020), the US provided more than $7.1 Billion in aid to Sub-Saharan Africa. Allocating these funds to countries that will distribute them equally among all citizens could be of importance to policy makers</strong></li>

# What is ethnic favoritism?

# Polity IV as a Measure of Democracy

<h3>The Political Instability Task Force, a government-funded project, administers the measure. The index categorizes countries using five criteria:</h3>

<h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Elections for the executive are competitive</li>
    <li>Openness in running for office</li>
    <li>Regulation of political participation</li>
    <li>Competitive political participation</li>
    <li>Constraints on the executive branch</li>
  </ol>
</h3>

# Data on Leader's Ethnicity

<h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Fearon, Kasara and Laitin (2007a) collected data on the ethnicities of the world's heads of states from independence to 2007</li>
    </ul>
</h2>

</br>

<h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I supplemented the data to include more leaders and years</li>

# Constructing the Co-ethnicity Variable

<h3>For each outcome I used in my analysis, I constructed a co-ethnicity variable:
</h3>

<h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Primary school education: the portion of time spent under the rule of a co-ethnic leader between the ages of 6 and 13</li>
    <li>co-ethnicity is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the leader two years before a child's birth was co-ethnic with the mother</li>
    <li>Wealth: the portion of time spent under the rule of co-ethnic leader in the four years before the survey</li>
    <li>Electrification & Access to water: the portion of time spent under the rule of co-ethnic leader in the two years before the survey</li>
  </ol>
