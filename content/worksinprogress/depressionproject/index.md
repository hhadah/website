abstract: "In this paper, I use a restricted longitudinal dataset, Add Health, to investigate the spillover effect of mental illness among friends on risky behavior, academic achievement, and labor market outcomes. I instrument the state of mental health of friends by the mental health of friends-of-friends. I find significant short-run effect on academic achievement, socialization, and risky behavior related to drug use. I find no long-run spillover effect of mental illness. The spillover effect of mental illness is stronger among females with a large network of friends."
